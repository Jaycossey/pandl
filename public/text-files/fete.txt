From Eden To Exile are back!
After some time away searching for a new vocalist. Theyâ€™ve found just the person by the name of Marcin.
Marcin has been on the scene for a few years within bands like Ashborn.
This track showcases a brand new sound while keeping certain elements of the back catalogue of From Eden To Exile.
Reason To Hate is a massive step up, from everything the guys have ever released. You can tell a lot of blood, sweat and tears have gone into the writing process of this track.
This track had everything you could ever need, aggressive screams. Which are complimented by very Travis Ryan (Cattle Decapitation) esque cleans which is deserving of a very big compliment as that is not an easy thing to do.
Reason to hate was produced by Stu McKay at Studio 6.
Who has worked with the likes of Dyscarnate, Ingested & Harbinger which shows why this track hits extremely hard from start to finish. As well as portraying a more polished sound that From Eden To Exile has created.
