On first overview of Vanitas, you wouldn’t expect Vanitas to produce tech metal music that you’d expect them to. However, everything they’ve released has been absolutely incredible and packs all the tech goodness you could ever need. 

Grey Morality, is a massive step up from everything they’ve released as it has the very operatic cleans but also the aggressive screams that mould perfectly to the music. 

Special mention has to go to the vocalist Jade Maris for the smooth transitions between cleans to harsh vocals that I have not heard in such a long time.

Vanitas shows no signs of slowing down, as they push on to get their cinematic djent sound, out there to the masses. 
I for one am now definitely a massive fan as I could have this on repeat and I am always finding something different to love within the songs, every time I listen to them.
