Having never heard of Stellvris is honestly the biggest crime you could do for yourself. This band has the potential to be one of the biggest bands sharing stages with the likes of The Amity Affliction, Spiritbox & Miss May I. They’d certainly give those bands a run for their money.
They have some of the most unique melodies within the songs that really captivates you on a level where nothing else matters.
Nicol really showcases such a strong vocal range within this EP which makes me think that she’d even give Courtney Le Plant a run for her money. I would pay good money for both bands to tour together as they would fit super well together, I would love to see them collaborate on each other’s songs as I could imagine that would be a masterpiece.
This whole EP showcases exactly what you need in your life. Groove ridden and aggressive verses alongside melodic choruses that have the vocals soaring you to new heights.
