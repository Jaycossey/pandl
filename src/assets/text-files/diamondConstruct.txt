Diamond Construct – Jynx (Single Review) 
 
 
Diamond Construct are back! With a brand-new track and it is the hard-hitting track that you just expect from them. 
They’ve the heavy sounds while also mixing distorted and clean vocals. Which really build this track up to be something special, that you honestly can’t help but bang your heads very fast to it. 
The vocals just mould together so perfectly that it honestly brings a smile to my face. I’ve had this track on repeat for days. As you can expect I keep picking up more unique sounds the track has to offer. Which is a step up from their last track ‘’Hit It Back’’, and I didn’t think that was possible in all honesty.  
This is the kind of track that I’d end up crowd killing my grandmother too. I must be careful in public, as I can’t help but move even if people are around.  
The enigmatic sounds that they bring to the table for this single, is something special and refreshing in a very stale music scene. Where it seems everyone just wants to be the heaviest thing in existence.  
Diamond Construct have officially signed with American label Pale Chord who are home to the likes of Spiritbox, Thousand Below and Harper.
