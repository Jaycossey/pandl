David - Releasing our debut album, Modern Error, on May 24th is a dream come true. This album has been a labor of love, and we're beyond excited to finally share it with everyone. It's a milestone moment for us, and we can't wait for everyone to experience the musical journey we've poured our hearts into.

Tony - Honestly it's been a long time coming. We started writing this album back in 2019 so it's overwhelming finally bringing this chapter to a close. So much has changed in that time. We went through Covid 19, I changed bands. I aged 5 years.
