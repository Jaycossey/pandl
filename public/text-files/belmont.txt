BELMONT are an exciting rock trio from Chicago, USA. Now bringing their new single ALL BITE, from their highly anticipated third album ‘Liminal’.


You are hit at full force with an intense guitar and drum introduction, which sets the tone for this track and gets the listener engaged from the first beat. This has a very interesting blend with a electronic-like backing track, which adds an extra dimension. Which ensure it is not like any other alt-rock track.


Knowing what the alternative rock and metal scene is like at the moment, these guys really stand out from the crowd. Making them easy to tour with a variety of many bands taking- keep your eyes peeled! Overall this is a decent single, but am in high anticipation for the full release in April as I think it will do well.
Keep your eyes and ears out for these guys!
